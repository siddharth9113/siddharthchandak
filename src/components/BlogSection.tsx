            <p>It all started with a simple problemâ€”college societies and fests needed custom merch, but the process was always a headache. Prices were unpredictable, quality was hit-or-miss, and dealing with vendors felt like running an obstacle course. I had no background in manufacturing or logistics, but I knew there had to be a better way. So, I dove in.</p>
            
            <p>At first, it was just me, my laptop, and a bunch of WhatsApp messages to vendors and clients. I remember our first big orderâ€”a batch of t-shirts for a college fest. I was excited, nervous, and had no idea how to manage production at scale. The order was delayed by two days, my supplier stopped answering calls, and I genuinely thought this might be the end before it even began. But somehow, after a few sleepless nights and some frantic phone calls, we pulled it off. Seeing students wear our merch at the event? That made it all worth it.</p>
            
            <p>Since then, 30byThirty has grown beyond just t-shirts. We now do notebooks, cups, tote bags, and more. We've worked with multiple colleges, streamlined our processes, and even started exploring AI-powered tools to make ordering seamless. But the journey is far from smooth. Cash flow is a constant challengeâ€”fests pay us after the event, but suppliers need upfront payments. Every month, there's a new learning curve.</p>
            
            <p>Still, the excitement never fades. There's something incredible about seeing an idea turn into something realâ€”something people wear, use, and associate with their college experiences. The late nights, the problem-solving, the small winsâ€”they make the struggle worth it. And this is just the beginning.</p>
            
            <p>If you've ever built something from scratch, you know the feeling. It's messy, unpredictable, and incredibly rewarding. Here's to the chaos of building something meaningful. ðŸš€</p>
