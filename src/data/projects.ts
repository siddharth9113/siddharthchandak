    description: "It all started with a seemingly small but incredibly frustrating problem. My co-founder's grandfather, a heart patient, had to carry stacks of medical records everywhere—hospital visits, check-ups, even emergencies. Every consultation meant sifting through old prescriptions, test reports, and handwritten notes. If one document was missing, it led to confusion, repeated tests, and wasted time. We realized this wasn't just his struggle—millions of people faced the same problem.\n\nDetermined to find a solution, we joined TiE's Young Entrepreneurs Program, where we pitched our idea of a digital medical records platform. We made it all the way to the final round, only to lose. But instead of feeling defeated, that loss only pushed us harder. We took the feedback, iterated on our idea, and entered more competitions. This time, we started winning—both recognition and prize money. Every win gave us the confidence (and funding) to take the next step.\n\nWith the money we earned, we hired developers and got to work. Building the app wasn't easy—we had to figure out security, usability, and data management. There were moments when we hit roadblocks, but every challenge pushed us to refine our solution. After months of hard work, we finally launched our app on the Play Store, turning our idea into a reality.\n\nWhat started as a personal frustration turned into a health tech startup making medical records digital, accessible, and hassle-free. Seeing people use our app to manage their health records, avoid paperwork, and get better care makes every setback worth it. The journey has been anything but smooth, but if there's one thing we've learned, it's this—problems are just opportunities waiting to be solved. And this is just the beginning.",
